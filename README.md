A playground intended for experimentation with Framer Motion, React and Tailwind

## Origin
This repository is part of my monthly frontend challenge. In this challenge, I will clone an advanced animation landing page, in order to practice and improve my frontend animation skills. Each month, I'll pick a new website from Awwwards, Apple, Google, or any other source, and complete it by the end of the month.

- **January 2022**: A partial clone of a Google Stories landing page, created with Framer Motion and GSAP.
